# Utilities Bot
Utilities is a simple bot for helping automate tasks on my Discord server.

Created by acatia#0001

## How to self-host
### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [Requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file

### Configuration
You will need to create a MongoDB document called `Cluster0`.

Configuration should be pretty easy, just go into the [CONFIG.py](CONFIG.py) file, and input all of the required fields.

To run the bot, do:
```
python bot.py
```
